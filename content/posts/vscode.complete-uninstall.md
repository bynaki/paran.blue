while writing go this morning, I found that the wrong code are not under lined by `red line` This is really difficult for me and time consuming to keep writing. After 1 hour of wasting time trying to figure out what happened, I decide to kill it all and start again. Hope this will be helpful for those who wants to complete remove `vscode` on their mac

## ATTENTION

please write down your extension lists, and settings (JSON) because you wonâ€™t be seeing this anymore (screen shot?)

> remember to quit vscode first

## Step1

remove settings and configs

```sh
rm -rf $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code
// add sudo if you needed to// if you're using insider*
sudo rm -rf $HOME/Library/Application\ Support/Code\ -\ Insiders/
```

## Step2

remove all the extensions

```sh
rm -rf $HOME/.vscode
// add sudo if you needed to// if you're using insider*
sudo rm -rf $HOME/.vscode-insiders/
```

## Step3

remove vscode from application

## Step4

[download vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and install again ;)
