## Where to find screenshots

By default, screenshots save to your desktop with the name ”Screen Shot [date] at [time].png.”

In [macOS Mojave](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201260) or later, you can change the default location of saved screenshots from the Options menu in the [Screenshot app](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/take-screenshots-or-screen-recordings-mh26782/mac). You can also drag the thumbnail to a folder or document.

## Learn more

- In macOS Mojave or later, you can also set a timer and choose where screenshots are saved with the Screenshot app. To open the app, press and hold these three keys together: Shift, Command, and 5. [Learn more about the Screenshot app](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/take-screenshots-or-screen-recordings-mh26782/mac).
- Some apps, such as the Apple TV app, might not let you take screenshots of their windows.
- To copy a screenshot to the Clipboard, press and hold the Control key while you take the screenshot. You can then paste the screenshot somewhere else. Or use [Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/kb/HT209460) to paste it on another Apple device.
